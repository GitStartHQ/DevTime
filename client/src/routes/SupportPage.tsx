          This app is made based on an open-source project by{' '}
          <a href="https://github.com/MayGo/tockler">@MayGo</a>. It is done in their own free time
          and often at expense of family, friends, and sleep. They would like to keep this app free,
          open-source, and improving over time. But for that, your support is needed.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          It is understandable if you can't give anything. You can always give some constructive
          feedback.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          So if you find this app useful then feel free to donate. Anything helps to keep this app
          up to date and always improving. They don't plan to get rich with that, need to justify
          working on this.
